Hi, welcome to J3ndra's personal blog. Before we continue our tutorial, I want to introduce myself. I'm Azra Muhammad Bhaskarogra, J3ndra's school friend, and i want to help J3ndra making some blog content about React and Material-UI.

So, before we get into the coding. Let's learn about Material-UI. Material-UI is an open-source project that features React components that implement Google's Material Design. Or simply, Material-UI can be used to build views on the front-end using ReactJS. And, now we're gonna jump into the coding! 

### Making React Project
First, we're gonna make a project using create-react-app. Type command below in terminal if you were using MacOS or Linux, or CMD if you're using Windows.  

`create-react-app material-ui-project`

create-react-app will make a folder project called `material-ui-project`. Then, type `cd material-ui-project`, to change to our project directory. If so, type `code` to open Visual Studio Code.

### Install Material-UI Library
We have initialized the project, now we will install the Material-UI library which we will use by entering the following command.

`yarn add @material-ui/core` or `npm install @material-ui/core`

Now, we've got Material-UI library installed, go to next steps!

### Deep Dive into Material-UI Documentations
Nah, after we got all the steps done. We can experimenting using component or other stuff in Material-UI by going into the documentations. In Material-UI, we can use Box, Card, Container, Typography and others component simply as typing HTML like tag, for example

`<Card>Here's the card</Card>`

`<Typography>Some text here</Typography>`

### Alternative way to use Material-UI
Honestly, there are some alternative to using Material-UI without setup from scratch. Namely by using a template or boilerplate. Type comaand below to use the template / boilerplate made by the Material-UI Team.

`curl https://codeload.github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 material-ui-master/examples/create-react-app`

`cd create-react-app && yarn install` or `cd create-react-app && npm install`

Okay, I thought maybe that's all I can say first. We apologize if there is an error in the presentation of the material or writing.

Thank you very much ~
